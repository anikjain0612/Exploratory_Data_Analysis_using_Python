To investigate different operators and expressions

To grasp fundamental input and output processes
​

Theory

1. Python Setup and User Interface

The Python setup offers utilities and interfaces for coding, running, and troubleshooting Python scripts. Python code can run through various interfaces like:

Python command line

Jupyter Notebook

Development tools (IDEs) such as Spyder, PyCharm, or VS Code

Online platforms like Google Colab

This setup enables coding, running commands, and seeing results in real time.
​

2. Python Execution Methods

Python offers two primary ways to run code:


a) Interactive Method

Runs commands line by line

Shows results instantly

Ideal for quick tests and learning basics

Examples include Python shell, Jupyter cells, and Google Colab.
​

b) Script Method

Saves code in a file and runs everything together

Best for full programs

Files end with .py
​

3. Comments in Python

Comments add explanations to code without running them, aiding clarity.

Single-line comments: Start with #

Multi-line comments: Use triple quotes (""" """)

They support documentation and code comprehension.
​

4. Variables and Naming Rules

Variables hold data in named memory spots.

Naming Rules:

Begin with letter (A-Z, a-z) or _

No starting digit

Case matters

Avoid Python reserved words

Python features dynamic typing—no need to declare types ahead.
​

5. Data Types in Python

Python has core data types for various data.

Core Data Types

Integer (int): Full numbers

Float: Numbers with decimals

String (str): Text sequences

Boolean (bool): True/False values

Use type() to check a variable's type.
​

6. Operators and Expressions

Operators apply actions to data and values.

Operator Categories

Math Operators: For calculations (+, -, *, /, %)

Comparison Operators: For checks (>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=)

Logic Operators: To link conditions (and, or, not)

Assignment Operators: For value setting (=, +=, -=, *=, /=)

Bit Operators: Bit-level actions (&, |, ^, <<, >>)

Expressions mix operators and data to yield results.
​

7. Simple Input and Output

These let programs interact with users.

Input:
input() takes user data as string; convert types if needed.

Output:
print() shows results; format with commas or strings.
# Basics of Python
In this experiment there is a brief description about the basic commands used in Python with their examples. It includes defining a variable, getting input from the user, performing basic arithmetic operations, and connecting it with real-life examples such as a simple calculator.
 
## Aim
To study the basics of Python instructions.
 
### Tools used
 Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
 
## Theory
        
Python was introduced in 1991 and was derived from many other languages, such as C, SETL, etc. It was preferred over many languages because of its 
easy-to-read language, easy-to-learn nature, and development speed over raw execution of code
 
In Python, many modules or libraries can be imported and functions present in them are used to perform some particular operations. Some modules are 
 
                    1) math
 
                    2) random
 
                    3) Pandas

In Python, when a variable is declared with a value,the interpreter automatically understands the data type and assigns that class of data type to it.In Python the data type of a variable is mutable and can be changed anytime and anywhere inside the code. But, a Python constant is such a variable whose value cannot be changed in the entire program.


There are basically 3 types of data types in Python. 
 
                (i) Built-in data type
 
                    a. Numeric types
 
                    b. Text type
 
                    c. Sequence Type
 
                    d. Mapping Type, etc.
 
                (ii) Mutability Comparison
 
                    a. Mutable
 
                    b. Immutable
 
                (iii) Specialized data types
 
                    a. datetime
 
                    b. Collections
 
                    c. Arrays


To get input from the user, the input function is used .To get a string input, the data type need not to be mentioned.
 
If an integer or float or a boolean value is taken as an input from the user, then the data type must be specified when
 
The command is written. To print something directly in the output, the "Print" function is used.


        Ex : int(input("The string to be written"))


There are many types of operators present in Python. Each operator has some unique function to perform.


        (i) Arithmetic Operations:
 
                It is used to perform arithmetic or mathematical operations.
 
        (ii) Assignment Operators:
 
                It is used to assign some value to a variable; that value can be a number, string, or any data type.
 
        (iii) Comparison Operators:
 
                It is used to compare the values of two variables to determine whether they are equal or, if unequal, which is greater. 
 
                and so on.
 
        (iv) Logical operators:
 
                It is used to perform logical operations such as AND, OR, and NOT.
 
        (v) Bitwise Operators:
 
                Same as in C programming, it is used to perform bitwise operations.
 
## Learning Outcomes
1) We learnt about data mutability and immutability and also learnt about the different data types falling in each category.
 
2) We also learned about type casting and also got to know that Python constants don't allow type casting.
 
3) We performed arithmetic and logical operations on variables and also built a simple calculator.
 
4) We also got to know about the user interaction and output handling.
 
## Applications
Python can be used on many platforms for many uses because of its easy handling and debugging properties. Some applications 
of it are    
 
    1) Netflix , Spotify
 
    2) NASA, ISRO
            
    3) Real Time Calculations in Transport and Logistics
 
## Advantages
            1. Rapid prototyping and interation
            2. Seamless Integration
            3. Dynamic Typing for Flexibility
            4. Automated Memory Management
 
## Conclusion
The basic functions of Python programming have been successfully executed and the output has been verified.
